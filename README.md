  - Difference between public and private.
  - Dynamic assigned.
  - You can point DNS using CNAME records. 
  - Static IP, allows A records to be set. SSL security. Useful for firewall settings. 4096 Private IP's per Vnet. 60 Public dynamic IP's, 20 Status public IP's
- Network Security Groups (NSGs):

  - Associated with vnets, subnets, vm's.
  - When Associated with a subnet the ACL is applied on that subnet.
  - Can only be applied within a region.
- Resource groups: 
  - Allows to operate on a group of resources.
  - Allows access control, billing, in-group communication.
  - Resource can only be part of one group.
  - No nesting is allowed. You can link however.
  - No limits.
  - Unable to rename after creation.
- Ingress/Egress:
  - Ingress: Data inbound to Azure. No charges for ingress.

  - Deallocated: You are no longer charged for the VM. Can use the API or Portal to deallocate the VM.
  - Availability Sets:
    - Availability sets ensure that the VMs you deploy on Azure are distributed across multiple isolated hardware nodes in a cluster.
    - At least two instances are deployed.
    - Do NOT mix workloads in an Availability Set.

  - Typically used together with SaaS.
  - Enables and allows Single Sign On (SSO) to any cloud or on prem app.
  - Has a Free, Basic and Premium plan.
  - Active Directory Connect is what Microsoft recommends to synchronize an on prem AD instance and an Azure Active Directory instance. Alternative is to use federation and password synchronisation.
  - Users and Groups are supported.
  - By default no Kerberos is enabled.
  - Authentication via protocols such as SAML, WS-Federation and OAuth.
  - Uses the Graph REST API
  - Management is done via Powershell or the Portal

  - Default; only allows outbound. No inbound.
- Data security in transit and at rest:
  - SSL/TLS (Https).
  - For data at rest the Azure Storage Service Encryption (SSE) must be used.
  - SSE works by encrypting the data when it is written to Azure Storage, and can be used for Azure Blob Storage and File Storage (currently in Preview).

- Access inheritance.
  - Azure subscription belongs to only one AAD.
  - Azure group belongs to only one subscription.
  - Resource belongs only to one group.

### Azure Mobile Apps
- Azure Mobile Apps: Provides capabilities (PaaS services) to make the development of Mobile Apps much more easy.
- Cross Platform Applications: Cross platform support (Windows, iOS, Andriod, HTML5, Xamarin, Apache Cordova.
- Offline Sync: allows to use the mobile app offline and sync mobile client data once it becomes online. Uses implicit push and incremental pull model.

  - Monitoring or tokens. Audit, logging, validation of inputs, SSL or cryptographic. 

### Hybrid Applications
- Service Bus Relay:
  - Allows apps to connect to your on premises services.
  - The Service Bus Relay runs in the cloud accepts the request and securely passes on that request to the WCF service running indside the corp network.

- Head node (controls the distribution of the jobs, can be on prem or cloud) and Compute nodes (execution of tasks)
- Azure Batch:
  - Job scheduling as a service, application lifecycle management, budget, quotas, users and limites.

### Designing Long Running Applications
- Jobs that take days, weeks, with the risk of interupption.
- Availability: Multiple instances, stateless vs state-ful, avoid single point of failures, deploy across regions
- Reliability: Faulty domains, error handling and retry, loose coupling, monitoring
- Scaling: planned versus reactive. Scaling up versus out, breaking up into smaller parts
- Other considerations: partition the workload, Logging, Retry on errors, Gracefully restart, check points, single instances (is_singleton:true)

### Selecting Storage Options

  - Backups are stored as blobs, Azure Storage Account is needed to store backups on.
  - High Availability consists of Availability, Scalability, Fault Tolerance.
  - Recovery Time Objective (RTO) = maximym amount of time to restore application functionality.
  - Recovery Point Objective (RPO) = acceptable time window of data loss.
  - Locally redundant storage (LRS) and Zone Redundant Storage (ZRS) storage stores 3 copies of your data in a single region, while Azure Geo Redundant Storage (GRS) and Read-access Azure Geo Redundant Storage (RA-GRS) stores 6 copies across two regions.
- Azure Resource Manager (ARM) Templates:

  - Orchestration (Apache Oozie for scheduling, Azure Data Factory)
  - Data Sources (Azure Blob Storage, Azure Data Lake Store, SQL Data Warehouse, Apache HBase, SQL Sources)
  - Extraction (Apache Scoop for file transfer, Apache Flume for large amount of log data)
  - Transform (SQL Server Integration Services, Split a single line of data into tables, validate against business rules), Hive for relational storage, Pig for processing, Pig works with SSIS.
- SQL Data Warehouse:
  - Massively Parallel Processing (MPP)
  - Data is broken into shards
  - Control node (the brain of the Database)
  - Compute (computational power from 1 to 60 nodes)
  - Data Movement Services - DMS coordinates data movements between all the nodes.
- Azure HDInsight Cluster Types:
  - HDInsight = Apache Hortonworks Data Platform (HDP or Hadoop)
  - 99.9% availabbility
  - Hadoop, Spark, Hive, LLAP, Hbase, Storm, etc.
  - Works with HDFS (hadoop filesystem)
  - Yarn (job scheduling)
  - MapReduce (parallel processing)
  - Spark is an open source distributed compute engine.
  - Hive is data warehouse for querying structured data. Works with HiveQL. Translates SQL to MapReduce.
  - Hive LLAP is called interactive Query on Azure.
  - HBase = column oriented key value store.
  - Kafka to process streaming data, Storm for real-time analysis on streaming data.
- Azure Data Factory:
  - Fully managed ETL service in the Cloud.
  - Run SSIS packages in the Cloud.
  - Piplelines (locical group of activities), activity (processing step), dataset (source of the data), linked services (input and output services).
  - Azure Data Factory v2 is in preview.
